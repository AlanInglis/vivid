Variable importance, interaction measures and partial dependence plots are important summaries in the interpretation of statistical and machine learning models. In our R package `vivid` (variable importance and variable interaction displays) we create new visualisation techniques for exploring these model summaries. We construct heatmap and graph-based displays showing variable importance and interaction jointly, which are carefully designed to highlight important aspects of the fit. We also construct a new matrix-type layout showing all single and bivariate partial dependence plots, and an alternative layout based on graph Eulerians focusing on key subsets. Our new visualisations are model-agnostic and are applicable to regression and classification supervised learning settings. They enhance interpretation even in situations where the number of variables is large and the interaction structure complex.


## Installation

The `zenplots` package (which is used within `vivid`) requires the `graph` package from `BioConductor.` To install the `graph` and `zenplots` packages use:
``` r
if (!requireNamespace("graph", quietly = TRUE)){
  install.packages("BiocManager")
  BiocManager::install("graph")
}
install.packages("zenplots")
```

You can install the released version of vivid from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("vivid")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/AlanInglis/vivid) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AlanInglis/vivid")
```

You can then load the package with:
``` r
library(vivid)
```
