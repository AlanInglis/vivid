Dear Dr. Hurley,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "vivid: An R package for Variable Importance and Variable Interactions Displays for Machine Learning Models" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces the package called `vivid` which provides examples on how to visualize and evaluate variable importance and variable interactions in machine learning models, using a range of displays including heatmap and graph-based displays for viewing variable importance and interaction jointly and partial dependence plots in both a matrix layout and an alternative layout emphasizing important variable subsets. We additionally discuss the design choices behind our implementation by focusing on the package structure and providing an in-depth look at the package functions and key features.


We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful for their work because it provides generally useful instructions with the intention of increasing a machine learning models' interpretability and making the work applicable to a wider readership.
